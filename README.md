# Perceptors : Smart Glasses for Blind

#### A Real Time Object Detection System with Voice Feedback and Distance Approximation For Blind using TensorFlow and Ultrasonic Sensor

We propose before you "Perceptors" - A.I. powered smart glasses that are able to detect objects in Real Time and alert the users if the object is in close vicini. This project is an attempt to provide the visually impaired people an opportunity to experience a normal life to some extent. Perceptors would alert the user in advance of the approaching object as well as it would help the user to identify the object in real time.
