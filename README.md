Project Title:
Perceptors: A Real Time Object Detection System with Voice Feedback and Distance Approximation For Blind using TensorFlow and Ultrasonic Sensor
 
Problem Statement
Using the most up-to-date studies, WHO estimates that the number of people with visual impairment is 285 million.  Of these, 246 million have low vision and 39 million are estimated to be blind. Out of these, over 15 million are from India. 
Visually Impaired people face many problems and are often met with challenges may it be in corporate or social field. They too have potential to contribute to this society if given a chance.

Introduction to Idea
We propose before you "Perceptors" - A.I. powered smart glasses that are able to detect objects in Real Time and alert the users if the object is in close vicini. This project is an attempt to provide the visually impaired people an opportunity to experience a normal life to some extent. Perceptors would alert the user in advance of the approaching object as well as it would help the user to identify the object in real time.
